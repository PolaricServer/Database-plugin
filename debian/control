Description: Polaric Server: APRS daemon part. 
 The "Polaric Server" is mainly a web based service to present APRS 
 tracking information on maps and where the information is updated 
 in real-time. It is originally targeted for use by radio amateurs 
 in voluntary search and rescue service in Norway. It consists of a 
 web application and a server-program (APRS daemon). 
 .
 This is a plugin that adds database storage using PostgreSQL 
 (with PostGIS). It stores APRS positions (spatiotemporal data) and 
 APRS packets for later analysis. It is configurable what callsigns 
 are stored and for how long. Queries include movement trails, positions 
 covered by digipeaters, etc. with this plugin you can go to a speficic 
 time in history and generate a map-overlay showing the situation at 
 that time (for data that is stored).
 .
 Client/user-owned data like trackers, static position objects, 
 map-extents, map-layer setups, etc through a REST API. Also, the 
 drawing tool uses it to store features. It also supports replication 
 (between server-instances) with eventual consistency (CRDT) for 
 some data objects.
