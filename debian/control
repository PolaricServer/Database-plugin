Description: Polaric Server: APRS daemon part. 
 The "Polaric Server" is mainly a web based service to present APRS 
 tracking information on maps and where the information is updated at real-
 time. It is originally targeted for use by radio amateurs in voluntary search
 and rescue service in Norway. It consists of a web application and a server 
 program (APRS daemon). 
 .
 This is a plugin that adds database storage using PostgreSQL (with PostGIS). 
 It is still in a somewhat experimental stage.
